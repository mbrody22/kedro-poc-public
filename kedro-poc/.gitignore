# MM Data Science base .gitignore file

# WARNING: this gitignore file uses a "whitelist" approach in
# which all files are ignored by default. Specific files and
# file types are then whitelisted for inclusion in the repository.
# The whitelist approach is *required* by Data Science's security team.
#
# For security & privacy reasons, Data Science requires that:
#
# 1. No files containing passwords or similar secrets exist in
#    any repository synced with GitHub, GitLab, etc.
#    EVEN IF GIT-IGNORED, THIS IS NOT PERMITTED.
# 2. All whitelisted files must contain no secrets or personally
#    identifiable information (PII), such as social security numbers,
#    policy numbers, etc.
#
# Whitelisting new file types requires manager approval.
#
# For more information, see:
# https://massmutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DSSE/pages/1227849947/Best+Practices+for+Protecting+Secrets
# https://massmutual.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/AAP/pages/1239779093/Required+Steps+to+Open+GitHub


# Ignore everything by default.
# REMOVING OR COMMENTING OUT THE LINE BELOW IS FORBIDDEN
# IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES.
*

# Permit whitelisted file extensions in all directories.
# OPTIONAL: for added security, you may replace this whitelist
# with targeted directory whitelists. To do this, add the lines
# !$FOO/
# !$FOO/**/
# for each directory $FOO you wish to whitelist.
# If you do not understand what this means or are not confident
# in making such a change, then DO NOT modify the line below.
!/**/

## other project-specific whitelist files
# Example: CSV with no secrets or PII used as synthetic data or for config.
# WARNINGS:
# - By adding a whitelist file, you are certifying that the file
#   contains no secrets or personally identifiable information, and you will
#   be held responsible for any breaches that result.
# - Do not whitelist with wildcards except with manager permission.
# - Do not whitelist Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) or similar embedded-data files.

# (i.e. src/data, src/models is not ignored by this pattern)

# NOTE:
# Each active contributor must certify that they will never store PII
# outside of the directories listed above
# (i.e., the presumed directories + your personal additions).
# To do this, write your name and the date below the following line:
# "I will never store PII outside of the above PII-permitted directories."

# Additional git-ignores based on common nuisance and personal directories and files,
# but are not strictly necessary for security, and are offered as suggestions.
# Ignore these directories and their contents, even if previous patterns
# would otherwise permit them.
